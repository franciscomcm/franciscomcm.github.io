## Hello,

I am a <a href="https://www.bone.ethz.ch/the-group/people/person-detail.MjUyMTcy.TGlzdC8xMzcyLC01MzUzOTg1MDM=.html">Doctoral student</a> at the <a href="https://www.bone.ethz.ch/"> Laboratory for Bone Biomechanics</a>, <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a>.

My research interests include Image analysis, Data science and Machine Learning and their applications to unravel bone mechanobiology.

Through scalable individualised computational methods, my goal is to extract relevant information from animal samples, from the cellular to the tissue level. I am interested in developing image analysis methods to capture biologically relevant data from histology images and *in vivo* micro-​Computed Tomography scans and leverage this information to improve the accuracy of existing *in silico* models of bone adaptation and their power to predict structural changes over different time-​scales.

> My caffeine comes from music, usually Progressive House.

I value being consistent, which has shaped some of my core principles: commitment, reliability, perseverance. Eager to take on new challenges, I believe adversity stimulates growth.

As hobbies, I like to run and play tennis, photography and learn new languages.
