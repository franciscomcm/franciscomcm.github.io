Welcome to the first post!

This blog is a reminder to regularly practice my writing skills while sharing my journey as a Doctoral student.

Having completed my first semester as a Doctoral student, I felt a clear transition from my previous student life. More than ever, time management is fundamental to balance my work with courses, collaborations with colleagues, teaching duties, administrative tasks, and personal life. Hence, my interest in exploring new ways to escalate my productivity has grown into a challenge.

The following posts will range from techniques and tools I leverage in my work, scientific programming, software tutorials and thoughts on various topics.
I hope it may give rise to constructive discussions and be useful for your work.

Thank you!
