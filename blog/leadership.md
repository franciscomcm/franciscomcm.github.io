# Hello!

Academic research groups often have a clear hierarchical structure, with doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, senior scientists, and ultimately, the principal investigator, typically a professor. As the group leader, the professor's role becomes paramount, as they are responsible for setting and managing the group's objectives while making critical decisions that protect the continuity of the research. Effective leadership in this context can make a significant difference, shaping the motivation and culture of the lab among colleagues. In this post, I would like to share some examples of excellent leadership attitudes I have recently observed from my supervisor, our group leader, in handling interpersonal conflicts and providing feedback on scientific projects. These examples demonstrate how outstanding leadership can positively impact the productivity and well-being of a research group.

# <a name="dynamics">Navigating interpersonal dynamics</a>

First, I would like to focus on a topic that does not necessarily relate to academic work. During research projects, conflicts in a team can arise due to disagreements over the best course of action to perform a study or present results in a publication. Depending on the topic, these may even require quasi-independent arbitration by the professor to reach an understanding between colleagues. Indeed, I recently participated in a meeting where such a discussion was taking place and would like to highlight the main steps my professor took to handle the conversation in a way that I found extraordinarily tactful and productive.

At the start of the meeting, he clearly defined the agenda and objectives, including the expected duration for each part, setting the stage for the upcoming topics, and indicating which ones would be prioritised. As the discussion advanced, secondary topics would arise spontaneously, and he skillfully redirected the focus back to the relevant topics at hand. While acknowledging and noting these other issues, this approach enabled the focus to be kept on the pre-agreed meeting agenda. Likewise, throughout the meeting, our professor frequently summarised the key takeaways, ensuring everyone was on the same page and the conversation could continue seamlessly. When approaching topics that would require making a decision, our professor would present the options available clearly and concisely, followed by generous opportunities for feedback from the participants. Notably, when potentially tense moments would arise, he could also diffuse them, preventing the discussion from escalating and returning it to a productive tone.

Overall, he actively encouraged contributions from all participants, maintaining a balance between moderating the conversation and participating as a stakeholder in the decisions. Ultimately, although we exceeded the expected duration, I felt energised and motivated to continue working, inspired by my professor's skilled facilitation. This was a valuable lesson in effective communication and conflict resolution within the academic setting.

A doctoral degree aims to equip researchers with the ability to conduct cutting-edge research independently. Indeed, it takes considerable commitment and skill to carry out high-quality research and produce scientific advancement for the community. Nonetheless, in this process, our research should be inspired and align with the direction the professor (and group leader) aims to pursue in their research.

For the past years, I have been working primarily on the research project I originally submitted with the aid of my professor, where we laid down the main topics and tasks of my doctoral work. As we are approaching the stage where we need to converge to a finalised product, what has been most fascinating is the shift in meeting interactions about the results that are, to me, much more complimentary. I can propose and quickly iterate on potentially relevant ideas and prepare material to share based on them. However, when discussing them with my professor, he can often take them further based on his interests and the type of scientific discoveries we would like to pursue. In other words, while I feel grounded in my work as I am familiar with its technical challenges and possibilities, my professor does not necessarily share this feeling, which allows him to freely elaborate on my results and point to where we should focus next. Often, these meetings become deeply intentional and intensive brainstorming sessions where we produce many great avenues to explore further and advance our research. This collaborative approach allows me to take my professor's input and continue polishing the work, integrating my technical knowledge to bring such visionary ideas to life.

Another exciting aspect of this topic is the cross-pollination of knowledge between fields. Despite my best efforts to stay up-to-date with research from different fields and identify new publications that may be useful in our work, I believe I still miss out on exciting ideas. Conversely, I have observed how, by attending different meetings and conferences, my professor has the chance to interact with established scientists from many fields and be exposed to a diverse range of content from which he can draw inspiration during our brainstorming sessions. Ultimately, with the technical confidence that new ideas can be implemented with rigour, such discussions feel incredibly productive and inspiring. More broadly, this collaborative supervision approach can be a crucial factor in the continued growth and success of graduate researchers, empowering them to push the boundaries of what is possible and explore new frontiers in their field of study.


# Conclusion

The leader of a research group can make a huge difference in shaping the team's direction, productivity, and well-being. By nurturing the conditions required for a constructive lab culture, with positive interactions between colleagues and productive scientific discussions that can lead to new insights, graduate students can grow personally and professionally towards a successful career.
