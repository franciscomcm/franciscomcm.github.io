# Hello!

Sedentarism has been identified as a dangerous threat to health and well-being in several professions. As someone working predominantly on my laptop, I have also experienced the effects of sitting for too many hours per day, from an acute discomfort in the legs to a prolonged sense of exhaustion that seems to not improve with sleep. Additionally, I have noticed how long, uninterrupted sessions starting at my screen increase the rate of headaches and eye strain. On another note, I have repeatedly seen many people on social media advocating for the importance and benefits of spending time outside, doing sports or walking in nature, preferably in broad daylight. Although in Zurich, the snow and ice can make it a challenge to go for runs safely on some days, I have been more intentional about incorporating walking tours into my daily routine, complementing indoor workouts, and helping to offset the harmful effects of sitting for too long. In this post, I would like to share my experience so far with this change of routine.

# <a name="outside_time">Time spent outside during the day is time well spent</a>

During winter, the shorter days and the cold temperatures can make it challenging to spend time outside. Indeed, I was often perplexed by how I would go to the office in the morning before sunrise and only return in the evening also at night, effectively spending all day indoors. In this routine, I was missing opportunities to take breaks and breathe fresh air while also skipping meaningful sun exposure, which can contribute to other health-related issues. Therefore, I have been focusing on one crucial adjustment: spending time outside during the day. Fortunately, my work is computational-based, giving me more flexibility to plan my day. In any case, here are some of the strategies I have been using to accommodate this goal. For example, instead of leaving early in the morning for the office, I can start my day remotely and complete some tasks until the sun rises; eventually, I take a mid-morning break to commute and ultimately arrive at the office and continue. Since I would have to commute anyway, I am shifting the time when it takes place within the day.

Additionally, as there is already plenty of daylight, I often opt to walk to two or three stations later on the public transport route I take to the office, which ends up yielding 20 to 30 minutes of walking. Besides, after arriving at the last station, I also look forward to another 15 minutes of uphill walk to reach my building. Alternatively, for full remote days, I often prefer walking after lunch (which I will expand on later) and, if necessary, mid-morning as a shorter break. Ultimately, with this approach, I can already include some physical activity early in the day, creating a noticeable sense of peacefulness that I can carry on to the remaining tasks.


# <a name="thinking_learning">Creating more space for thinking and learning</a>

While I am fortunate to have enough flexibility in my work and plan my day-to-day schedule, I am often still overwhelmed with the tasks I need to accomplish for my project and ongoing collaborations. On top of that, research work typically requires reflecting on innovative ways to approach a problem or to explain a result produced in the studies. However, with the incessant demands of each back-to-back assignment, it can be challenging to find the time to think clearly and quietly about such problems. On this note, going for a walk has helped me to create a space dedicated to these questions. Even if I am not actively thinking about them, I often return energised and can come up with a solution.

On another note, when I would rather distract my mind and learn something instead, I have also used this time to listen to science-related podcasts I enjoy. Episodes are often longer than the duration of my walks, so I can continue listening over two or three walks. These help me learn something new as they are often science- or health-related while also making walking quite enjoyable. Indeed, there were several podcasts that I enjoyed following but struggled to find an ideal time to consume the content. In this approach, it became pretty straightforward to combine both activities effectively. On a side note, as I aim to go to a park or other nature-related trail, I particularly enjoy (re-)discovering the paths available on these routes to complete small tours.


# <a name="sleepiness">Overcoming that early afternoon sleepiness</a>

As I mentioned above, I aim to go for a walk after lunch on remote-office days. On the one hand, there is evidence that walking after lunch aids digestion; on the other hand, I have also noticed how this practice helps me overcome some sleepiness, which I would often counter with a nap. Instead, going for a walk (especially in a slightly colder environment) allows me to feel more alert while also maintaining a sense of calmness, such that upon my return, I no longer need to nap, and I am nicely energised to resume working. This advantage alone has been tremendously helpful in tackling afternoons without hesitation and sustainably maintaining my energy levels for the rest of the day.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, I have been enjoying going for a walk and spending more time outside. While at first, I was reluctant that it could interfere with my schedule and limit the time available to complete my work, it is becoming clear that I am mostly rearranging how time is spent during the day. Although there are days when I do end up working fewer hours, I still feel equally productive and capable of maintaining the amount and quality of my output while benefitting from additional physical activity.
